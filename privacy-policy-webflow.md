## Introduction

Phil It In ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the Phil It In Chrome extension handles your data and information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any user data.**

Phil It In does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information, browsing data, or user-generated content. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser.

## How the Extension Works

### Local Operation

All operations performed by Phil It In occur entirely within your browser on your device. The extension:

- Generates test data locally using client-side JavaScript
- Fills form fields on web pages you visit
- Does not require internet connectivity to function (except to access the websites you visit)
- Does not communicate with any external servers or third-party services

### Generated Data

The extension generates fake, randomly created data for the purpose of filling out web forms. This data includes:

- Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- Street addresses, cities, states, zip codes
- Credit card numbers (fake, for testing only)
- Other form-related test data

**IMPORTANT:** All generated data is fake and should NEVER be used for real transactions, identity verification, or any legitimate purposes. This extension is designed for testing and development purposes only.

## Data Storage

Phil It In does not persist any data between browsing sessions. The extension generates information only when you request it and does not save it to your device or any external service.

## Third-Party Services

Phil It In does not:

- Integrate with any third-party analytics services
- Use tracking pixels or cookies for tracking purposes
- Send data to advertising networks
- Share information with data brokers or analytics companies
- Use any external APIs or services

## Permissions Explained

The extension requests the following permissions:

### activeTab Permission

This permission allows the extension to access the currently active browser tab only when you explicitly click the extension icon. It is necessary to read and fill form fields on web pages.

### scripting Permission

This permission is required to inject content scripts into web pages to identify and fill form fields. Scripts are only injected when you explicitly request form filling.

### <all_urls> Host Permission

This permission allows the extension to work on any website you visit. This is necessary because forms can appear on any domain. The extension only activates when you explicitly invoke it, and it does not collect or transmit any data from these websites.

## Children's Privacy

Phil It In does not knowingly collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. However, you can:

- Uninstall the extension at any time through Chrome's extension management page
- Clear any locally stored preferences through your browser settings
- Review this Privacy Policy at any time

Since we do not collect any personal data, the extension inherently meets privacy requirements by design.

## Security

- All operations are performed locally in your browser

- No external connections are made for extension functionality
- The extension uses only standard Chrome extension APIs
